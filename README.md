## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of concerns between views and business logic  
- **ObservableObject**: ViewModels trigger UI updates  
- **CoreData**: Robust local storage solution  
- **Modular Components**: Reusable SwiftUI views  

### Key Components
- `ChecklistView`: Main screen displaying all checklists  
- `ChecklistDetailView`: Individual checklist management  
- `AddItemView`: Form for new items  
- `ChecklistViewModel`: Manages business logic and data  
- `PersistenceController`: Handles CoreData operations
